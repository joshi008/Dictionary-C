# Dictionary-C
A dictionary app where one can add words with meaning but the interesting part is the lookup for the words. We can check for a part of the word and it will show suggestions according to words present inside the dictionary.

This was an assignment from my data-structures professor.

Example: search for "pineapple"

Output: the word "pineapple" was found with meaning "a large juicy tropical fruit consisting of
aromatic edible yellow flesh surrounded by a tough segmented skin and topped with a tuft of
stiff leaves."

Did u mean "crisis", "critic", "crispy", "cricket"
